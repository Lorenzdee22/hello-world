# hello-world
This is my first time using github and even trying coding. This is my introduction code to the software engineering program organised by ALX.
My name is David Lawrence. I am a biochemistry who earns from graphic designs and now wants to venture into the world of software engineering. I am very excited to begin this journey and hope that i follow through to the very end
